\section{New Chat GPT features}
\label{sec:ai}






Recently Chat GPT unveiled its most recent AI version. In this new version ChatGPT can now send and edit images to your liking. More language support has made it so more people can use this technology, and they’ve increased the security of the AI. Another change they made is a multitude of new voices that the AI can use when responding to prompts. How OpenAI went about implementing these voices raises questions about AI ethics and copyright. \cite{ChatGPT-changes}

Among the voices that you can choose from in this new ChatGPT feature, one of them sounded very familiar to many people. This new voice sounded almost exactly like the voice of the AI assistant in the movie “Her”. Her is a movie which was released in 2013. The plot is that the main character, Theodore Twombly, falls in love with an artificial intelligent virtual assistant. The AI in this movie has a very comforting, perhaps even flirtatious tone in it. \citep{Her}
